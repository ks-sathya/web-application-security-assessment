# web-application-security-assessment
This repository contains a sanitized security assessment of a deliberately vulnerable web application completed as part of an academic security exercise.
The goal of this project was to identify common web application security weaknesses, assess their impact, and propose remediation strategies aligned with industry best practices.

Important:
All sensitive details, exploit payloads, endpoints, credentials, and tooling have been deliberately removed to ensure responsible disclosure.

Scope of Assessment:
•	Authentication mechanisms
•	Access control enforcement
•	Session and token handling
•	Cryptographic implementations
•	File upload and file access controls
•	Input validation and trust boundaries

Key Vulnerability Categories Identified:
•	Broken Access Control (IDOR)
•	Insecure JWT implementation
•	Weak session and client-side state handling
•	Unrestricted file upload
•	Path traversal / arbitrary file read
•	Insecure cryptographic practices

Documentation:
•	Full Sanitized Report: pentest_report.pdf
Each finding includes:
•	Vulnerability description
•	Impact assessment
•	Root cause analysis
•	Recommended remediation

Skills Demonstrated
•	Web application penetration testing
•	Secure design analysis
•	Risk-based vulnerability assessment
•	OWASP Top 10 mapping
•	Professional security reporting

Responsible Disclosure:
This repository intentionally excludes:
•	Exploit code or payloads
•	Step-by-step attack instructions
•	Real IP addresses, domains, or secrets
•	Tool-specific exploitation techniques
